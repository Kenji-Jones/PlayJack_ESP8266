# PlayJack_ESP8266
This is a proof of concept using
- Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266
- NRFL01+
- WS2812B (NeoPixels)
- fastLED library
- TMR rf24 library
- add a logic level shifter to change 3v3 to 5v for the LED signal pin. (flickering issue)
- Captive portal testing (i want to add a color picker if possible?)

I'm using nhaduy99/Walkgreen v2.0 for captive portal / wifi connectivity reference 

I still need to add the pinout for the project.
